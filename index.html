				<p>Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr; are two of the greatest theoretical physicists of all time. Today, let us go back in time and enjoy the series of public disputes between these two legends! These two gentlemen always liked each other, respected each other and enjoyed the debates among them. An interesting twist came before the debates, soon after photons were introduced in physics. These days, we view photons as a hallmark of quantum theory. So, we might generally expect the pro-quantum theory guy to be a great champion of photons and the anti-quantum theory guy to be their foe. But, the truth was the other way around. Surprisingly, Einstein liked the photons and Bohr did not.</p>
